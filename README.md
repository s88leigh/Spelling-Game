### Name of App: Spelling-Game

### Type of Users:

    Individuals of all ages

### Intended Goal:

    To provide a User-friendly, simple, fun, interactive app to help children under 10 years of age learn how to spell words through repetition. However, in the process of developing this app, I realized that such apps can be helpful to a broader population: Children, Individuals with cognitive disorder, Parents, non-English speakers.

# For Children:

    * To have fun while learning how to spell

# For Parent:

    * To provide a child with a fun and interactive way to learn how to spell (and keep track of progress in future iteration)

# Non-English speakers:

    * To have a fun and simple way to learn how to spell english words through repetitiion

# For Individuals with cognitive disorder:

    * To have an app that is User-friendly

### Directions on how to play this game:

1.  On the landing page, choose among the 5 categories.
2.  After a category has been chosen, a random image will appear along with underscores that matches the length of the word to be spelled.
3.  Once the correct letter from the keyboard is selected, it will replace the existing underscore in order from left to right.
4.  Once all the underscores have been replaced by the correct letters:
    a) The spelled word will appear to the left of the image in a list that is limited to 5 words. The newly spelled words will continue to be added to the existing list from the top. When the number of words reach 5, the bottom word disappears.
    b) A random message of congrats will appear for 2 seconds under the image.
5.  The User, at any time, can choose to select another category of spelling words by clicking on the 'Choose another Category' button.

### Future iterations:

    1. Provide a Progress Report page that will keep track of:
        a) the number of times the User practices spelling a certain category
        b) level of difficulty
        c) number of words spelled correctly/incorrectly
        d) speed
    2. Allow individuals to add new words.
    3. Allow User to select level of difficulty.
    4. Provide an optional timer to be used to test for proficiency.
